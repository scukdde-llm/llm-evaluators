			"output" : "1. Collaboration: This approach involves working together with the parties involved in the conflict to find a mutually beneficial solution. It requires open communication, active listening and cooperation to come up with a solution that addresses the needs and interests of all parties.\n\n2. Compromise: This involves finding a middle ground where both parties involved in the conflict are willing to make concessions in order to reach an agreement. It requires negotiation skills, and the willingness to give and take to achieve a resolution that is acceptable to everyone.\n\n3. Mediation: In this approach, a neutral third party facilitates communication between the conflicting parties to help them reach a resolution. The mediator helps to clarify issues, identify underlying concerns, and encourages the parties to come up with their own solutions. This approach can be helpful when the parties involved are having difficulty communicating or finding common ground."

			"output" : "A beach vacation is an ideal way to unwind and rejuvenate, surrounded by the beauty and serenity of nature. With the sun shining bright and the sound of waves crashing on the shore, it is the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. You can spend your days lounging on the soft, white sand, taking a refreshing dip in the crystal-clear waters, or participating in exciting water sports. As the sun sets, enjoy a leisurely stroll along the shore, breathing in the salty sea air and taking in the stunning views. In the evenings, relax with a tropical cocktail and indulge in fresh seafood cuisine while watching the stars twinkle above. A beach vacation truly has something for everyone, whether you're looking for adventure or just some peace and relaxation."

			"instruction" : "Explain why computers are faster than humans in solving math problems.",
			"output" : "There are several reasons why computers are faster than humans in solving math problems:\n\n1. Processing speed: Computers are designed to process information at an incredibly high speed. They are equipped with powerful processors that can perform billions of calculations per second, making them much more efficient than the human brain in terms of raw processing power when solving mathematical problems.\n\n2. Precise algorithms: Computers use precise algorithms and sequences of instructions to solve mathematical problems. These algorithms are specifically designed to solve certain types of problems in the most efficient manner possible, often taking advantage of shortcuts, patterns and parallel processing techniques that humans would struggle to identify and exploit.\n\n3. Lack of distractions: Unlike humans, computers do not get distracted, tired or bored. They can work tirelessly and continuously without their performance being affected. This means they can solve complex mathematical problems over extended periods of time without making mistakes or losing focus.\n\n4. No mental fatigue: Humans are susceptible to mental fatigue, which can greatly impact our ability to solve mathematical problems. As we become tired or lose focus, we may start making mistakes or become less efficient. Computers, on the other hand, do not suffer from mental fatigue, and their performance remains constant over time.\n\n5. Large memory capacity: Computers have the ability to store large amounts of data and retrieve it quickly. This means they can hold vast quantities of information in their memory and rapidly access the data required to solve a mathematical problem. Humans, on the other hand, are limited by their memory capacity and can struggle to remember all the necessary information when solving complex problems.\n\nOverall, computers are faster than humans in solving math problems due to their high processing speed, precise algorithms, lack of distractions, constant performance, and large memory capacity."

The `abs` function is used to return the absolute value of the difference between these two numbers. This way, even if the result of the subtraction is negative, the absolute value will always be positive."

			"instruction" : "How can one increase their self-confidence?",
			"output" : "There are several ways to increase self-confidence, some of which include:\n\n1. Practice positive self-talk: Positive thinking can help boost your self-confidence. Replace negative thoughts with positive ones and practice positive affirmations.\n\n2. Set achievable goals: Setting achievable goals and meeting them can give you a sense of accomplishment and boost your confidence. Start small and work your way up to bigger goals.\n\n3. Take care of yourself: Practice good self-care habits like eating well, exercising regularly and getting enough sleep. Looking after your physical health can help improve your mental wellbeing and confidence.\n\n4. Learn from failures: Failure is inevitable, but it is important to use these experiences as opportunities for growth. Learn from your mistakes and keep moving forward, this will help boost your confidence.\n\n5. Step out of your comfort zone: Taking on new challenges and pushing yourself out of your comfort zone can boost your confidence. Try something new and don\u2019t be afraid to take risks.\n\n6. Surround yourself with positive people: Being around positive and supportive people can help boost your confidence. Surround yourself with people who encourage you and believe in your abilities.\n\n7. Work on your posture and body language: Good posture and body language can help you exude confidence. Stand tall, make eye contact and smile to project confidence to others."
